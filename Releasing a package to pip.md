# Releasing a package to pip

### Install the required packages:

> Setuptools: Setuptools is a package development process library designed for creating and distributing Python packages.
> 
> Wheel: The Wheel package provides a bdist_wheel command for setuptools. It creates .whl file which is directly installable through the pip install command. We'll then upload the same file to pypi.org.
> 
> Twine: The Twine package provides a secure, authenticated, and verified connection between your system and PyPi over HTTPS.
> 
> Tqdm: This is a smart progress meter used internally by Twine.
